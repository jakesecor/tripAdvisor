Trip Advisor: An Analysis
Intro
Domain
•	What is trip advisor what does it do
•	Facts/stats about trip advisor
Motivation
•	What are the problems/inefficiencies that trip advisor suffers from (generic)
Business Question
•	What factors determine ranking? Q1
•	What type of customer is likely to give a certain rating? Q2
•	What we did to answer Qs (overview)
Overview of Dataset
•	What type of variables everything is
•	Number of rows
•	Descriptive stats about data
•	Any outliers, if we felt like we should remove things
•	Visualizations of data

Econometrics
•	Correlogram- nothing is incredibly related so we would not expect high r2s?
o	Only think that is related is vote and helpfulness of review- which intuitively makes sense but does not tell us much about the data (correlations)

 


•	OLS- all numeric- service, vibe, desert, bathroom, drink, cost, music, location, parking, lunch, breakfast, dinner, totalreviewsofreviewer, avghelpfulnessofreviewer (Q1) (Model Selection)
o	R2 value= .03185
o	Significant variables ***= service, vibe, desert, bathroom, cost, music, location, lunch, breakfast, totalreviewsofreviewer, avghepfulnessofreviewer
o	Significant variables **= parking
o	Significant variables . =dinner
•	OLS- only significant variables- same r2 (Q1)
•	OLS- positive words in review (Q1)
•	OLS- Only significant ones (Q1)
•	OLS- reviewer type (Q2) (Feature Engineering)
•	Discuss the goodness of fit of the model (R^2, AIC etc.)
•	Discuss the significant coefficients (show the table and highlight the coefficients of interest) 
•	Explain how the set of independent variables affect the dependent variables

Data Mining
•	Word Cloud
•	Accuracy
•	AUC
•	NB
•	SVM
•	Mention that you split the data into training and test sets and how you did it
•	Show the accuracies (and the accuracy curves if applicable) 
•	Show the AUC scores, and explain why this model is good or bad 
•	If you compared multiple models try to visualize their performance
•	

Conclusions
•	Overview
•	Answer business question
•	Main takeaways
•	Make recommendations
•	Other questions we would want to look further into
