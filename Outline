Analytic Business Intelligence


Trip Advisor: An Analysis
Intro
Business Question
•	What factors determine ranking? Q1
•	What type of customer is likely to give a certain rating? Q2
Overview of Dataset
•	What type of variables everything is
•	Any outliers, if we felt like we should remove things

Econometrics
•	Correlogram- nothing is incredibly related so we would not expect high r2s?
o	Only think that is related is vote and helpfulness of review- which intuitively makes sense but does not tell us much about the data

 


•	OLS- all numeric- service, vibe, desert, bathroom, drink, cost, music, location, parking, lunch, breakfast, dinner, totalreviewsofreviewer, avghelpfulnessofreviewer (Q1)
o	R2 value= .03185
o	Significant variables ***= service, vibe, desert, bathroom, cost, music, location, lunch, breakfast, totalreviewsofreviewer, avghepfulnessofreviewer
o	Significant variables **= parking
o	Significant variables . =dinner
•	OLS- only significant variables- same r2 (Q1)
•	OLS- positive words in review (Q1)
•	OLS- Only significant ones (Q1)
•	OLS- reviewer type (Q2)

Data Mining
•	Word Cloud
•	Accuracy
•	AUC
•	NB
•	SVM

Conclusions
•	Answer business question
•	Make recommendations
•	Other questions we would want to look further into
